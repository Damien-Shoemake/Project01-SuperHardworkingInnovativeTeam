# Project01: Event-Easy

## üèÜDescription

- The motivation behind creating this webpage was to help address the everyday concerns and problems of travel coordination, by implementing a website that helps users search for events & lodging options in relation to the location of their choosing.
- The purpose of this particular project displays our knowledge of class topics covered through the first six modules of our course, as our group members worked in a collaborative enviroment to use the tools and practices learned to create this final product. 
- Throughout the process of working on this project, we all learned how to operate on Github within project repository, including creating & merging branches, navigating through pull requests and issues, hosting scrum meetings, and most importantly getting hands on experience working with other classmates, which helps all involved learn how to communicate and work collectively to accomplish a number of tasks.

## Usage

Below you will find a screenshot of the home page you will see when you first load up. Once you have the home page pulled up, 
theres a search bar at the top where you can enter a city of your choice. The moment you click search, different hotels and 
events will populate the cards pinned to the screen. If you'd like you can save the various hotels and events to an itinerary
to view at any time. You may save up to 4 itineraries at a time. 

(add screenshot of deployed site with searched city here)

When you search for a city, then the cards on the screen will display hotels in the area on 1 card and then display events on the 2nd card. When you find a hotel/event you like, you can click on the text to save it to an itinerary to view/change at a later time. You may have up to 4 itinerearies at any given moment.
