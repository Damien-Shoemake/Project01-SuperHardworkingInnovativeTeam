# Project01: Event-Easy

## Description

- The motivation behind creating this webpage was to help address the everyday concerns and problems of travel coordination, by implementing a website that helps users search for events & lodging options in relation to the location of their choosing.

- The purpose of this particular project displays our knowledge of class topics covered through the first six modules of our course, as our group members worked in a collaborative environment to use the tools and practices learned to create this final product. 

- Throughout the process of working on this project, we all learned how to operate on Github within project repository, including creating & merging branches, navigating through pull requests, issues, and merge conflicts, hosting scrum meetings, and most importantly getting hands on experience working with other classmates, which helps all involved learn how to communicate and work collectively to accomplish a number of tasks. 


## Usage

Below you will find a screenshot of the home page you will see when you first load up. Once you have the home page pulled up, 
theres a search bar at the top where you can enter a city of your choice. The moment you click search, different hotels and 
events will populate the cards pinned to the screen. If you'd like you can save the various hotels and events to an itinerary
to view at any time with the option of clearing said itinerary.
